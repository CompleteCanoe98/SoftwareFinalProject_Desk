Created the main front end viewing experience for the user. Displayed the home page that offers
different function options such as creat an event, delete an event, viewing an event, and editing
an event. Additionally I worked to begin implemening the actual create function that displays a
seperate window that asks for user input regarding event details.

Worked to finish the main functions, specifically delete and edit, focusing on the visual experience
provided to the user, allowing for ease of usability.
