In this project, we created a basic UI Home Widget for a To-Do List application using Tkinter. 
The main window includes buttons for creating, deleting, updating, and viewing tasks. 
Each button is linked to a function that currently prints a message to the console. 
This setup provides a foundation for further development of the application's functionality.

Today, we significantly improved the To-Do List application by introducing persistent storage 
using a JSON file. This ensures that all events are saved to a file and automatically loaded 
when the application starts, preventing data loss between sessions. 

We also implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality:
- **View Events**: Users can view a list of all saved events dynamically.
- **Edit Event**: Users can modify the details of an existing event.
- **Delete Event**: Users can remove an event from the list.
These updates make the application more robust, practical, and user-friendly, laying the 
groundwork for future enhancements such as improved UI, search functionality, and user roles.
